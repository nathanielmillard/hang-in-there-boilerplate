## Name: Hang In There: Team Hang’n In there

### Background:
This is a project for Mod_1 at Turning’s Front End Engineering Program. The original repo this was forked from can be found at:
Features: This is a website that randomly generates an inspirational “poster” from a data bank of images, titles, and quotes. The user has a few options they can engage with on the bottom of the page. Left to right you can Save the Poster, View Saved Posters, Show Another Random Poster, and Make Your Own Poster. The saved poster option stores the currently visible poster, and only once. The Saved Posters section should show a grid of any and all posters the user has saved in this session in reverse chronological order. The Show Another Random Poster will continue to generate new posters randomizing the image, title, and quote. But! That’s all from a stored bank, and the user may want to create something of their own, or even just add options in to be randomized. So last we have the Make Your Own Poster button, that pulls up a form for user input of an image link, title, and quote. Once a user inputs these values they are actually stored in the banks of images, titles, and quotes, for the duration of their session for future randomized posters. Every new section also has a button with a variety of verbiage that will allow for a user to navigate back to the main page.

### Roadmap:  
We would love to implement a feature where users can double click on a saved poster and have the poster removed, giving users more control over what is saved and where.
We also may look at implementing a few potential features for more interactive user interfacing. The first being error messages, and further communication to the user as they attempt to fill out the form. Also giving users more freedom to only randomize one feature of the displayed poster, as opposed to randomizing the entire thing. And continuing past being able to delete posters from the saved grid, it would be great for users to be able to drag and reorder posters as well as having the ability to display them larger again.

### Contributing:  
At this time we aren’t open to contributions on this project, but open to any communication for reviews and potentially more features/implementation.

### Project status:
At this time this project is going to stay the way it is, pending feedback from instructors. There may be time and availability to expand upon and refine this project in the future, but we haven’t concretely planned for or allotted time to continue to develop this.

### Authors and acknowledgment:
The authors are Nathaniel Millard and Joe Varela. (link to gitHub accounts)
We want to thank the Turing School for the skills to accomplish this project, and discussion and reviewing from Jake West, John Adams, Kim McCaskill, and the patience of our partners and family while we take time to work, as well as attempt to explain our processes to them along the way.
