// Iteration 2 Steps
// A) On the new poster form view, users should be able to fill out the three input
//    fields and then hit the save button
// B) When the save button is clicked, several things will happen:
// 1) Save the submitted data into the respective arrays (image URL into the
//    images array, etc) so that future random posters can use the user-created data
// 2) Use the values from the inputs to create a new instance of our Poster class
// 3) Change back to the main poster view (hiding the form view again)
// 4) Display the newly created poster image, title, and quote in the main view
